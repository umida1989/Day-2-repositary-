We just published our local Git Repo 
to remote GitHUb>com reposotory
Few things happen:
1.Automatically created new remote Repo under GitHub.com account
2.Made the connection with local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo


Now our work will continue locally 

1. add a new file called note.txt 
2. commited the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository so We PUSHED local commits to remote repository using push origin button 
4. Observe it has been added in your repository under GitHub.com
